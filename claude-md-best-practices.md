# Managing and Updating Your CLAUDE.md File for Claude Code

## What is a CLAUDE.md File and Why It Matters

**CLAUDE.md** is a special Markdown file that Anthropic’s Claude Code will automatically load into context whenever you start an AI coding session. In essence, it serves as a persistent project-specific prompt or “memory” for the AI. Because Claude includes this file as the first message (with system-level importance) every time, it uses CLAUDE.md to understand your project’s nuances and follow your guidelines. All AI agents (including sub-agents Claude might spawn) have access to this file, so a **well-maintained CLAUDE.md is crucial for consistent behavior across the board**. Treat it as the **main prompt** or rulebook for your codebase that *overrides default behavior* – Claude is instructed that it “MUST follow them exactly as written”.

In practical terms, a good CLAUDE.md file saves time and tokens. By having key context documented up front, Claude doesn’t need to repeatedly rediscover obvious things (like how to build your project or your coding style) through trial and error. Instead, it can refer to CLAUDE.md for guidance, leading to more accurate code generation and fewer mistakes.

## What to Include in CLAUDE.md

Think of CLAUDE.md as the place to put **all the important information about your project that you’d want a new developer (or AI assistant) to know**. There’s no strict format, but it’s best kept **concise, bulleted, and human-readable**. Common content sections include:

* **Build & Run Commands:** List the essential scripts or commands to build, test, run, or deploy the project. For example, you might include commands like `npm run build` (with a brief description: “Build the project”) or testing commands like `yarn test`. This way Claude *always knows* how to compile or test without scanning your entire `package.json` each time.
* **Development Workflows:** Document typical workflows and etiquette. For instance, note if developers should run a linter or type checker before committing (`yarn lint`, `yarn typecheck`), how to run single-file tests for faster feedback, or any continuous integration steps. If your team follows specific git conventions (branch naming, rebase vs merge, commit message style), list those too.
* **Code Style and Guidelines:** Specify coding conventions unique to your project. This can include language or framework preferences (e.g. “Use ES Modules, not CommonJS” or “Always use MUI components for UI”) and stylistic rules (“Destructure imports when possible”). Essentially, any rules you’d remind a human contributor about style or patterns can go here.
* **Project Architecture & Key Components:** Provide a high-level overview of the codebase structure. You might list core directories or files and their purpose (e.g. “`src/queries/` – query functions for UI elements” or “`src/index.ts` – main entry point”). This helps Claude understand relationships between modules and where to place new code.
* **Testing and QA Notes:** If certain testing approaches or frameworks are used, note them. For example, “Use Jest and Testing Library for all tests” or “Prefer writing unit tests before implementing features (TDD)” could guide the AI’s behavior. Also mention how to run tests (e.g. “`yarn test:ci` for CI environment”).
* **Environment Setup & Dependencies:** Document anything unusual about your environment. For instance, “Requires Python 3.10 with pyenv” or “This project uses a custom GCC compiler, installed via X.” If specific environment variables or API keys are needed to run the code, mention how they are provided (though do not include sensitive values themselves).
* **Known Quirks or Warnings:** If your project has any “gotchas” or pitfalls, definitely note them. For example, “On Mac, use Xcode 14; Xcode 15 causes compile errors” or “The first test run is slow due to seeding a database.” These warnings can save Claude from chasing known issues repeatedly.
* **Any Other Important Context:** Essentially, **anything you want Claude to remember or obey** consistently belongs in CLAUDE.md. This could include project goals, domain-specific terminology, or external resources. Some users even include a brief **Project Overview** describing what the software does and its scope, giving Claude the “big picture” (similar to a README but focused on guiding the AI).

**Tip:** Organize the file with clear headings for each section (as shown above) and use bullet points for easy scanning. The goal is to maximize signal and minimize noise – Claude is more likely to absorb a short bullet like “- **Use semantic HTML5 elements in UI**” than a rambling paragraph. Also, avoid dumping large chunks of code or exhaustive documentation; stick to summary and guidance. If you provide concise pointers, Claude can always open and read the actual files when needed.

## Keeping CLAUDE.md Up-to-Date: Manual vs. Automated Approaches

Maintaining your CLAUDE.md is an ongoing process. As your codebase and practices evolve, **you should update CLAUDE.md to reflect those changes**. There are two complementary ways to do this: manual curation and using Claude Code’s automation to assist.

### **1. Manual Updates (Curating CLAUDE.md by Hand)**

Many developers treat CLAUDE.md like any important documentation – whenever a significant change is made in the project, they update the file. For example, if you add a new script (`yarn dev` for a development server), you’d add it to the “Commands” section. If you adopt a new library or coding pattern, note that in the guidelines. This manual approach ensures the info is precise and vetted.

Best practices for manual maintenance include:

* **Edit Frequently:** Don’t let CLAUDE.md get stale. After merging a major feature or setup change, take a moment to revise any affected instructions. Keeping it “evergreen” means Claude’s guidance will always be relevant.
* **Keep It Lean:** Resist the urge to stuff every detail in. A commonly echoed tip is that *the CLAUDE.md file should be lean*. Include only information that is truly helpful for guiding the AI (or a new contributor). If it grows too long with outdated or trivial info, it can waste context window and even dilute the important points. One Reddit user noted, *“don’t overdo it… The Claude.md file should be lean”*. (Of course, as another user replied, sometimes complex projects *need* more instructions – use your judgment.)
* **Version Control It:** It’s recommended to check your CLAUDE.md into your repository (unless it contains personal notes). By committing it to Git, you ensure team members share the same project instructions and you can track changes over time. Some teams even code-review changes to CLAUDE.md as part of pull requests, just as they would code or regular docs.
* **Refine Wording for Clarity:** Over time, you might notice Claude ignores or misinterprets some instruction. In such cases, rephrase it. Anthropic engineers suggest iterating on the prompt wording to see what yields the best compliance. Don’t hesitate to add emphasis or stronger wording if needed. For instance, prefacing an important rule with “**IMPORTANT:**” or “**YOU MUST** …” can improve adherence. (Claude’s own system says those instructions override defaults, but a little extra emphasis can help!)
* **Prune Outdated Info:** If something in CLAUDE.md is no longer true (e.g. you removed a command or changed a tool), update or remove that entry promptly. Stale instructions can confuse the AI. One community member warned that even with clear info, the AI might occasionally ignore or “forget” it – outdated info only makes that more likely. Keeping it accurate increases the odds Claude will act correctly.

By manually curating, you maintain high-quality, trustworthy instructions. However, this can be time-consuming, especially in fast-changing projects. That’s where automation comes in.

### **2. Using Claude Code to Auto-Generate or Update CLAUDE.md**

Claude Code provides features to help you build and evolve your CLAUDE.md with minimal manual effort:

* **Initial Auto-Generation (`/init`):** When you first run Claude in a project, you can use the `/init` command. Claude will scan your codebase and **automatically generate a starter CLAUDE.md** summarizing the project. This is extremely useful to bootstrap the file. It typically includes key build commands, a high-level project summary, and possibly important files it detected. Think of it as Claude’s first draft of your project memo. Always review this generated content – it’s a great baseline, but you may want to edit it for accuracy or completeness. (As one user noted, Claude’s auto-generation is good but might not catch everything unique in a complex enterprise project without guidance.)
* **On-the-Fly Memory Adds (`#` Command):** Claude Code has a neat **“memory” shortcut**: pressing the `#` key in a Claude Code session lets you add an instruction that Claude will save into the relevant CLAUDE.md automatically. For example, if during a coding session you realize “Oh, we should always use `XYZ` library for logging,” you can type something like: `# Always use our custom Logger from utils instead of console.log`. Claude will append that to the CLAUDE.md file (choosing the project or subfolder file that’s most relevant). Engineers report using `#` frequently to document new commands or decisions *as they work*, which keeps CLAUDE.md up-to-date in real time. This is a powerful way to **capture tribal knowledge on the fly** – essentially having Claude assist in writing its own notes.
* **Ask Claude to Update It:** You can explicitly instruct Claude to update the CLAUDE.md when things change. For instance, if you just created a new module or refactored part of the code, you might say in the chat: *“Add an entry in CLAUDE.md about the new authentication module and how it works.”* Claude can then write the appropriate addition, and with your confirmation, edit the CLAUDE.md file for you. In one shared strategy, a user even scripted Claude to document each major feature in separate markdown files and update CLAUDE.md with an index of features – an elaborate approach to large projects.
* **Periodic Regeneration / Auditing:** As your project grows, consider re-running `/init` (or an equivalent) periodically to see if Claude picks up something you missed. While there isn’t an official “/update CLAUDE.md” command yet, users have requested it. For now, you can simulate it by running `/init` in a new session (perhaps on a branch or temp clone) to get a fresh summary and then manually merging any new insights into your main CLAUDE.md. This can reveal outdated sections or new recommended entries. Anthropic has hinted at possibly adding a dedicated update command to maintain the file more easily, which shows how important this upkeep is.
* **Automation Scripts & Hooks:** Some advanced users create scripts or use Claude Code’s hooks to keep CLAUDE.md in sync. For example, you could imagine a git commit hook that reminds developers to update CLAUDE.md if certain files (like build scripts) changed. Although not built-in, a community member suggested a shell script to append a summary of “work done for the day” to CLAUDE.md, effectively giving Claude a running log to recall tomorrow. This isn’t standard, but it shows the creative lengths people go for long-term memory. Another example is using Claude’s **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to integrate with external tools or notes – one developer added instructions in CLAUDE.md to make Claude journal its tasks to an external note-taking app after each operation. That way, there’s a separate log of progress. While that particular use (journaling) doesn’t update CLAUDE.md itself, it demonstrates how you can automate tasks by **embedding procedures in CLAUDE.md**.

**Bottom line:** You have a spectrum of options from fully manual to AI-assisted updates. A practical approach is a hybrid: **use `/init` to jump-start the file, then maintain it manually with regular small edits, using the `#` memory feature or direct prompts to Claude to help when convenient.** Always review automated changes for correctness. Automation can save time, but **you remain the curator** who ensures the file stays accurate and useful.

## Tips and Best Practices for CLAUDE.md Maintenance

To summarize and provide a go-to list, here are the best tips and tricks shared by Claude Code users for creating and managing CLAUDE.md:

* **Prioritize Relevance and Clarity:** Include only information that you want the AI to consistently remember or obey. Use clear, simple language and bullet points. Claude will ignore or forget instructions that are buried in noise, so make each item count. If Claude frequently misses an important point, consider rewording it or moving it higher in the file.
* **Keep it Concise (but Complete):** A lean file is easier for the model to digest. However, don’t omit critical context just to keep it short. Aim for a balance: comprehensive *coverage of key points* in as few words as possible. For instance, a bullet saying “Use our `ApiClient` for HTTP calls (do not use axios/fetch directly)” is brief but very instructive if that’s a project rule.
* **Structure by Sections:** Organize content under sensible headings (Setup, Commands, Code Style, Architecture, etc.) as demonstrated earlier. This not only helps human collaborators but also provides logical chunks for the model. Claude was even observed to create a structured CLAUDE.md with sections when using `/init`. Consistent formatting (like `##` for section titles and `-` for list items) can’t hurt.
* **Use Hierarchical CLAUDE.md Files for Large Projects:** Claude Code supports multiple CLAUDE.md files at different levels of your project directory structure. You can have one in the root of the repo (general guidelines) and additional ones in subfolders for module-specific instructions. Claude will automatically pull in *all relevant CLAUDE.md files* – with more specific, nested ones taking priority for their scope. This is a great way to keep each file focused. For example, in a monorepo, `frontend/CLAUDE.md` might contain front-end specific rules, while `backend/CLAUDE.md` has backend API notes, in addition to the root CLAUDE.md with things applying to the whole project. Use this feature to avoid one gigantic file.
* **Leverage a Global CLAUDE.md for Personal Preferences:** In addition to project files, Claude Code allows a global user CLAUDE.md (e.g., in your home directory) that loads for all sessions. You might store your general preferences here – for instance, “I prefer snake\_case for filenames” or “Always write self-documenting code with comments”. This global file will have lower priority than project-specific ones if both are present, so it won’t override project rules but can fill gaps. It’s like setting your personal default behaviors for Claude. Just remember to keep global instructions generic enough to apply everywhere.
* **Integrate Updates into Workflow:** Encourage a culture where updating the CLAUDE.md is part of your development process. This could mean adding a checkbox in your PR template (“Update CLAUDE.md if needed”) or simply reminding each other. As Anthropic’s guide notes, many engineers include CLAUDE.md changes in commits alongside code changes so that teammates benefit. Treat it as a living document.
* **Use Claude’s Help to Maintain It:** Don’t think you must write the whole thing alone. Claude is quite capable of summarizing code or generating documentation when asked. If you’re short on time, use the assistant: *“Claude, scan the repo and suggest any new info that should go into CLAUDE.md.”* It might find a missing script or note. One user described recursively having Claude navigate the project and create CLAUDE.md files in every directory – an extreme case, but it shows Claude can document a lot if you let it. You might not need 300 markdown files, but you *can* ask Claude to draft sections and then you edit as needed.
* **Emphasize Non-Negotiables:** If there are rules Claude absolutely must follow (like “don’t modify certain files” or “follow security checklist for auth code”), call them out with bold text or all-caps keywords. Anthropic sometimes runs CLAUDE.md through a prompt improver tool to make instructions more explicit and forceful. For example, you could write: “**IMPORTANT: Never commit secrets** – YOU MUST NOT include API keys in code.” While the AI might occasionally err, clear warnings do help.
* **Include Session-Specific Goals Temporarily:** A clever trick some users employ is adding the current task’s goal to CLAUDE.md at the start of a session. For instance, if you’re working on a “Shopping Cart feature”, you might prepend a note in CLAUDE.md like “Current goal: Implement Shopping Cart functionality (list, add, remove items)”. This way, even if Claude spawns sub-agents or the session gets complex, that high-level goal stays in context for all agents. Just remember to remove or update this later so it doesn’t linger after the task is done.
* **Monitor Claude’s Behavior and Adjust:** Pay attention to whether Claude actually follows the instructions in CLAUDE.md. If you notice it repeatedly “forgets” something (like a build step or naming convention), that’s feedback to improve the file. You might need to make that point more prominent or verify if some other context is pushing it out. On the flip side, if Claude is consistently doing something right because of CLAUDE.md, you know your guidance is effective. It can be rewarding to see it say, *“I ran `yarn lint` as per the project instructions”* without you telling it in the moment – that’s CLAUDE.md doing its job!

By following these practices, you’ll create a robust CLAUDE.md that truly acts as a helpful guide for the AI (and for any new developers). An up-to-date, well-crafted CLAUDE.md file means **less back-and-forth explaining your project to Claude and more productive coding**.

## Conclusion

Keeping your CLAUDE.md file up-to-date is key to getting the most out of Anthropic’s Claude Code. Think of it as programming the AI with your project’s “common sense” – the better you maintain that file, the better Claude can assist you. Start by populating it with the fundamental info about your project (you can use `/init` for a quick start), and then iterate: continuously refine and update it as your project evolves. Use the tools at your disposal (like the `#` memory shortcut and Claude’s own abilities to edit files) to automate where possible, but always ensure the final content is accurate and succinct.

In summary, **treat CLAUDE.md as a living document** and part of your development workflow. When well-managed, it becomes an incredibly powerful prompt that steers Claude’s coding suggestions and actions in the right direction. With the best practices and tips shared by the community – from keeping it lean to automating updates – you can create a CLAUDE.md that significantly enhances Claude’s effectiveness on your software projects. Happy coding with Claude!
