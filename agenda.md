### Claude Code Power User Workshop — Agenda

#### Agenda

**Part 1: Foundations and Customization**

- Welcome, housekeeping, and introductions
- Compare GPT-5 and Claude Code
- Interactive demo: using Claude; managing Git permissions
- Permissions: acceptEdits
- IDE integration with Cursor; explain selected code
- CLI print mode; `--allowedTools` for non-interactive tasks
- Build a reusable ZSH wrapper function
- Explore `.claude` directory and JSONL conversation logs
- Customize behavior with `--append-system-prompt` (e.g., French, Deadpool)
- Usage insights with `ccusage`; subscription value

**Part 2: Advanced Workflows & Context**

- Demo: spawning sub-agents for parallel research
- Community tools and usage limits
- IDE features: `/export` and inline diff preview for edits
- Tool demo: claude-explorer for searching past conversations
- Mindset: “Hypothesis Mode” (try → learn → iterate)
- Discussion: the learning curve and developer stress
- Aliases and keywords: Opus, Dopus, Popus
- Thinking budget: UltraThink
- Security: API keys via a password manager and scoped sessions

- Strategy: the “Rule of Threes” for clearer decisions
- Lunch break
- Context compaction in long-running conversations
- Deep dive: Hooks with `claude-hooks`
- Deep dive: Agents, `/agents`, and `@` usage
- MCP demo: DeepWiki for code-aware repo analysis
- Compare context tools: DeepWiki vs Context7 vs `LLMs.txt`
- Tool demo: `ghx` for just-in-time GitHub examples
- Workflow demo: ContainerUse for safe, parallel work with auto-commits

**Part 4: Advanced Context & Final Q&A**

- Managing artifacts; using Git history as source of truth
- “Claude Video” workflow: analyze recording → generate detailed prompt
- Generate diagrams: Search Editor context → Mermaid
- Final Q&A: agent orchestration, task tools, scheduled agents, future workflows
- Wrap-up and thanks
